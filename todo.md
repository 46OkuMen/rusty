* "Are you strong, lady?" in scene 1 is the same color as Rusty's text, which is confusing
	* Both Nett and Mina's animations are active during the "I was fighting with my sister" line, which is also confusing
* Manual edits to fix corruption in Gateau's speech in scene 2
	* "Lady M2ry". Is there a pointer that's getting weirdly edited here, or something?
* Fix Mayor's final animation in scene 4
* Ending scroll pointer is wrong? Cuts off the beginning of the string

## STORY/ENEMY.COM

## JO.EXE
