Romhacking utilities and notes developed as part of [46 OkuMen](http://46okumen.com/)'s English translation patch for *Rusty* (PC-98), a pretty decent clone of Castlevania.

### How do I use this?
* Download the patch from [romhacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/2997/) or from [the 46 OkuMen project page](https://46okumen.com/projects/rusty/).

* Using the utilities yourself would be difficult without having our internal translation spreadsheet and game images.
